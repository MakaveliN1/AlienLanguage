# Alien Language Generator
This program generates random "characters" in a made-up alien language. Each character is stored in a two-dimensional array of characters, which is square (e.g. 5x5). The program randomly draws lines (horizontal or vertical) and places "o"s into the 2D array. The lines have a random starting cell and length.
